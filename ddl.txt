___

## Introduction
Name  : Yonathan Anggraiwan

This program was designed to implement an end-to-end data pipeline from PostgreSQL to ElasticSearch, utilizing an employee performance and productivity dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/employee-performance-and-productivity-data). 

The project also includes data validation using the Great Expectations framework, and the results are presented through an interactive dashboard built with Kibana.
